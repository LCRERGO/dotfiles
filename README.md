# dotfiles
--------
This is my personal dotfiles repository. It does not contain my personal
scripts which are used on my system, and my Window Manager
configuration, if needed they can be checked in other repositories.

This is the Njord flavor.

## Applications
---------------
This requires the following applications to run in a clean way:
- st (Terminal Emulator)
- ghc (Haskell Suite)
- dunst (Notification Deamon)
- git (Version Control)
- irssi (IRC client)
- mpd (Music Daemon)
- ncmpcpp (Music Client)
- newsboat (RSS feed client)
- nvim (Editor)
- emacs (Editor)
- radare2 (RE suite)
- tmux (Terminal Multiplexer)
- zathura (PDF Reader)
- vimb (Web Browser)
- wyebadblock (Ad Block) with easylist
- tabbed (Tab support)
- xwallpaper (Wallpaper setter support)
- zsh (Command Line Shell)

###### Zsh Dependencies
- [Spaceship Prompt](https://github.com/spaceship-prompt/spaceship-prompt)

###### Vim Dependencies
- VimPlug (Plugin Management)
- Golang (Plugin hexokinase)
- Node
- [NerdFonts](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts)

## Caveats
To use colored emojis on st (which is required when used with spaceship prompt
with rust) the symbola font **must** be installed on the system.
