# dotfiles
----------
This is my personal dotfiles repository. It does not contain my personal
scripts which are used on my system, and my Window Manager
configuration, if needed they can be checked in other repositories.

This is the Mittermeyer flavor.

## Applications
---------------
This requires the following applications to run in a clean way:
- gnome-terminal (Terminal Emulator)
- git (Version Control)
- nvim (Editor)
- emacs (Editor)
- tmux (Terminal Multiplexer)
- bash (Command Line Shell)

###### Vim Dependencies
- VimPlug (Plugin Management)
- Golang (Plugin hexokinase)
- Node
