# dotfiles
--------
This is my personal dotfiles repository. It does not contain my personal
scripts which are used on my system, and my Window Manager
configuration, if needed they can be checked in other repositories.

This is the Longphort flavor.

## Applications
---------------
This requires the following applications to run in a clean way:
- XFCE4(Desktop Enviroment)
- git(Version Control)
- nvim(Editor)
- bash(Shell)

###### Vim Dependencies
- VimPlug(Plugin Management)
- Golang
- Node
